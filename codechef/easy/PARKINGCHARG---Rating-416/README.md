## Problem

### Parking Charges

Chef needs to park her car while she watches a movie. The parking charges at the theater are as follows:

- Rs. $X$ for the first 1 hour
- Rs. $Y$ for every extra hour after the first hour

If Chef parks her car for $H$ hours, what is the total parking charges that she should pay?

### Input Format

The only line of the input will contain three space separated integers - $X$, $Y$, and $H$.

### Output Format

Output a single integer, which should be the total amount that Chef pays as parking charge.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq X \leq 100$
- $1 \leq Y \leq 100$
- $1 \leq H \leq 100$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
10 1 5

```

```
14

```

### Explanation:

$X = 10$, which means that for the first hour, Chef has to pay Rs. 10.
$Y = 1$, which means that for every extra hour, Chef has to pay Rs. 1.
Chef needs to park for $H = 5$ hours.

So, for the first hour, she will pay Rs. $10$. And for the $5 - 1 = 4$ hours extra, she will pay $4 * 1 =$Rs. $4$. So in total, she has to pay $10 + 4 =$ Rs. $14$.

### Sample 2:
Input
Output

```
1 10 100

```

```
991

```

### Explanation:

$X = 1$, which means that for the first hour, Chef has to pay Rs. 1.
$Y = 10$, which means that for every extra hour, Chef has to pay Rs. 10.
Chef needs to park for $H = 100$ hours.

So, for the first hour, she will pay Rs. $1$. And for the $100 - 1 = 99$ hours extra, she will pay $99 * 10 =$Rs. $990$. So in total, she has to pay $1 + 990 =$ Rs. $991$.

### Sample 3:
Input
Output

```
10 15 1

```

```
10

```

### Explanation:

$X = 10$, which means that for the first hour, Chef has to pay Rs. 10.
$Y = 15$, which means that for every extra hour, Chef has to pay Rs. 15.
Chef needs to park for $H = 1$ hours.

So, for the first hour, she will pay Rs. $10$. And she does not have to pay any more. So in total, she has to pay Rs. $10$.
