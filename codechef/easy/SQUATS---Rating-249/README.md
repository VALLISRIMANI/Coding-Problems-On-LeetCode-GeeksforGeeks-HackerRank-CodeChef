## Problem

### Squats

Somu went to the gym today. He decided to do $X$ sets of squats. Each set consists of $15$ squats. Determine the total number of squats that he did today.

### Input Format
- The first line contains a single integer $T$ — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
- The first and only line of each test case contains an integer $X$ — the total number of sets of squats that Somu did.
### Output Format

For each test case, output the total number of squats done by Somu.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 1000$
- $1 \leq X \leq 10^5$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
3
1
4
99

```

```
15
60
1485

```

### Explanation:

 **Test Case 1:**  Since, he does only $1$ set of squats, the total number of squats done by him is $15$.

 **Test Case 2:**  Since, he does $4$ sets of squats, the total number of squats is $15 + 15 + 15 + 15 = 60$.

```c_cpp
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int t;
    scanf("%d", &t);

    // Loop for each test case
    while (t--) {
        int x;
        scanf("%d", &x);

        // Multiply the number of sets by 15 and print the result
        printf("%d\n", x * 15);
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```
