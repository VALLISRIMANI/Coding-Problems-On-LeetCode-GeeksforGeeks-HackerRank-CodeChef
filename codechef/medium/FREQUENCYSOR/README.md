## Problem

### Chef and Character Frequency Sort

Chef is experimenting with strings. He wants to rearrange all the characters of a given string  **$S$**  in decreasing order of their frequency.

If two characters have the same frequency, Chef sorts them in  **lexicographical (ASCII) order**.

Help Chef by printing the final rearranged string.

### Function Declaration
- Function Name: $sortByFrequency$
- Parameters: $s$ ($string$) A string consisting of uppercase and lowercase English letters and digits.
- Return Value: Returns a $string$ representing the rearranged string after sorting by the given rules.
### Input Format
- The first and only line contains a string S.
- The string consists of uppercase and lowercase English letters and digits.
### Output Format

Print the rearranged string after sorting by the given rules.

### Constraints
- $1 \le |S| \le 5 \times 10^{5}$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
CookBook

```

```
ooookkBC

```

### Explanation:

 **Input:**  `CookBook`

The character frequencies are:

- o $\rightarrow$ 4
- B $\rightarrow$ 1
- C $\rightarrow$ 1
- k $\rightarrow$ 1

Chef first places characters in  **decreasing frequency**  order, so `o` comes first as `oooo`. The remaining characters all have the same frequency  **1**, so they are arranged in  **ASCII (lexicographical) order** :

`k < B < C`

So the final rearranged string is:

```
ooookkBC

```

### Sample 2:
Input
Output

```
aabbbcddd

```

```
bbbdddaac

```

### Explanation:

 **Input:**  `aabbbcddd`

The character frequencies are:

- b $\rightarrow$ 3
- d $\rightarrow$ 3
- a $\rightarrow$ 2
- c $\rightarrow$ 1

Characters with frequency  **3**  are `b` and `d`, and since `b < d`, they appear as: `bbbddd`

Then `a` appears twice: `aa`

Finally, `c` appears once: `c`

So the final rearranged string is:

```
bbbdddaac

```

```java
public static String sortByFrequency(String s) {
    //write your code here...
    HashMap<Character, Integer> freq = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
        char ch = s.charAt(i);
        freq.put(ch, freq.getOrDefault(ch, 0) + 1);
    }
    
    List<Character> chars = new ArrayList<>(freq.keySet());
    Collections.sort(chars, (a, b) -> {
        int fa = freq.get(a);
        int fb = freq.get(b);
        
        if (fa != fb) {
            return fb - fa;
        }
        
        return a - b;
    });
    
    StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
    for (char c : chars) {
        int count = freq.get(c);
        for (int i = 0; i < count; i++) {
            result.append(c);
        }
    }

    return result.toString();
}
```
