# Maximum Packages within Time

## Problem

A delivery agent has to deliver packages at locations arranged in a line. The number of packages at the **ith**  location is given by  **arr[i]**.

- The agent can start at any location and can only visit consecutive locations.
- Time required for every location is 1 unit.

Given  **arr[]**  and  **totalTime**, find the maximum number of packages the agent can deliver within  **totalTime**.

 **Examples** :

```
Input: arr[] = [2, 1, 3, 5, 0, 1, 4], totalTime = 3
Output: 9
Explanation: The agent can visit three consecutive locations. Starting from the second location, it delivers arr[1] + arr[2] + arr[3] = 1 + 3 + 5 = 9 packages.
```

```
Input: arr[] = [1, 6, 2, 5, 3, 4], totalTime = 2
Output: 8
Explanation: The agent can visit two consecutive locations. Starting from the second location, it delivers arr[1] + arr[2] = 6 + 2 = 8 packages. Starting from the fourth location gives arr[3] + arr[4] = 5 + 3 = 8 packages. Hence, the maximum is 8 packages.
```

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxPackages(int[] arr, int totalTime) {
        // code here
        int k = Math.min(totalTime, arr.length);
        int sum = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            sum += arr[i];
        }
        
        int maxSum = sum;
        
        for (int i = k; i < arr.length; i++) {
            sum += arr[i];
            sum -= arr[i - k];
            maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, sum);
        }
        
        return maxSum;
    }
}
```
