## Problem

Given a string  **s** containing alphanumeric characters. You have to calculate the sum of all the numbers present in the string.

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: s = "1abc23"
Output: 24
Explanation: 1 and 23 are numbers in the string which is added to get the sum as 24.

```

```
Input: s = "geeks4geeks"
Output: 4
Explanation: 4 is the only number, so the sum is 4.
```

class Solution {
    public static int findSum(String s) {
        // code here
        int sum = 0, num = 0;
        
        for (char ch : s.toCharArray()) {
            if (ch >= '0' && ch <= '9') {
                num = num * 10 + ch - '0';
            } else {
                sum += num;
                num = 0;
            }
        }
        sum += num;
        
        return sum;
    }
}
