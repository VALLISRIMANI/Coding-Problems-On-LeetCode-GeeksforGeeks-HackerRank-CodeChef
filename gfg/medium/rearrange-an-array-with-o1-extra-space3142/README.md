# Transform Array In-Place

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

Given an integer array **arr[]**  of size  **n**, where each element lies in the range [0, n-1], transform the array such that every element at index  **i**  becomes:
 **arr[i]=arr[arr[i]].** 

The transformation must be performed in-place, meaning the same array should store both the original and updated values without using another array.

**Examples:
**

```
Input: arr[] = [1, 0]
Output: [0, 1]
Explanation: The original array is [1, 0]. 
At index 0, arr[0] = 1, so the new value becomes arr[1] = 0. 
At index 1, arr[1] = 0, so the new value becomes arr[0] = 1. 
Thus, the transformed array becomes [0, 1].

```

```
Input: arr[] = [4, 0, 2, 1, 3]
Output: [3, 4, 2, 0, 1]
Explanation: The original array is [4, 0, 2, 1, 3]. 
Each element is replaced by the value at index arr[i] in the original array. 
So the new values become 3, 4, 2, 0, 1 respectively, and the transformed array becomes [3, 4, 2, 0, 1].
```

 **Constraints:** 
1 ≤ n ≤ 4*104
0 ≤ arr[i] < n

```java
class Solution {
    public void arrange(int[] arr) {
        // code here
        int n = arr.length;
        int[] temp = new int[n];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            temp[i] = arr[i];
        }
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            arr[i] = temp[temp[i]];
        }
    }
}
```
