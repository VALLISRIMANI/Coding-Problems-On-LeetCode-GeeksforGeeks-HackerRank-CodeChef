# Customer Placing the Largest Number of Orders

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Table: `Orders`

```
+-----------------+----------+
| Column Name     | Type     |
+-----------------+----------+
| order_number    | int      |
| customer_number | int      |
+-----------------+----------+
order_number is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
This table contains information about the order ID and the customer ID.

```

 

Write a solution to find the `customer_number` for the customer who has placed  **the largest number of orders**.

The test cases are generated so that  **exactly one customer**  will have placed more orders than any other customer.

The result format is in the following example.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: 
Orders table:
+--------------+-----------------+
| order_number | customer_number |
+--------------+-----------------+
| 1            | 1               |
| 2            | 2               |
| 3            | 3               |
| 4            | 3               |
+--------------+-----------------+
Output: 
+-----------------+
| customer_number |
+-----------------+
| 3               |
+-----------------+
Explanation: 
The customer with number 3 has two orders, which is greater than either customer 1 or 2 because each of them only has one order. 
So the result is customer_number 3.

```

 

 **Follow up:**  What if more than one customer has the largest number of orders, can you find all the `customer_number` in this case?
